# Authentication System

**Disclaimer:** This project is developed for personal use and as part of a portfolio. I am not responsible for any issues that arise from using this system.

## Overview
This project provides a ready-to-use authentication system with minimal configuration.  

The system ensures:

- **Stateless Authentication:** With JWT, user sessions are managed without maintaining server-side state.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Permissions can be implemented by encoding roles or privileges into the token claims.

It supports registration and authentication via:
- **Username and password**
- **Google** (OAuth 2.0)
